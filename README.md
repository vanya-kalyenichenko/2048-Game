## Project Overview
This is a browser-based implementation of the popular game 2048. The goal is to combine matching tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile. It's a fun and addictive puzzle game that challenges your strategic thinking and decision-making skills.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vanya-kalyenichenko/2048-game.git
    ```
2. Install a package:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start a package:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage Guide
1. The game is played on a 4√ó4 grid.
2. Swipe left, right, up, or down to move all tiles in that direction.
3. Each swipe spawns a new tile (either 2 or 4) on an empty space.
4. Tiles with the same value merge into one tile when moved next to each other.
5. Keep merging tiles to reach the 2048 tile.
